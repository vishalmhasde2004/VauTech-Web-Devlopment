## Project Outcome

* Developed a **fully semantic and accessible HTML page**
* Improved understanding of **HTML5 structure and accessibility principles**
* Learned how accessibility enhances user experience for diverse audiences
* Created a strong foundation for responsive and accessible web development

---

## Key Learnings
